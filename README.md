This is a work in progress. Come back later.

This is the web app used for initial registration of bionet labdevices (printers and scanners).

bionet labdevices are USB devices connected to a computer (usually a small single-board computer) running the [bionet-labdevice](https://github.com/biobricks/) software.

The labdevices keep a connection alive to their parent bionet node and receive print job from that node.

When a labdevice is first powered on, it needs to know which bionet node is its parent. This web app assists in this one-time configuration procedure.
